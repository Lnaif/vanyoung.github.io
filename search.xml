      <content type="text"><![CDATA[前言Hexo是一个非常好用的静态博客生成器，但在使用过程中尤其是第一次使用可能会遇到诸多报错。可能由于配置、操作不当、版本迭代、Hexo本身的BUG导致使用不顺畅。 本文主要记录我在使用Hexo中遇到的问题，遇到BUG可通过issues给Hexo作者提出问题或意见。 遇到的问题npm安装问题npm安装Hexo依赖包过慢解决方案 使用VPN 使用淘宝镜像 1npm install -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org 安装时报错报错git is not command 解决方案： 需要配置git的环境变量到系统变量中去。操作:添加如下路径到系统环境变量的PATH中 123C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_yourpath\cmd或C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_yourpath\usr\bin 注意，此路径是指向你的git安装路径中的装有git.exe的文件夹，不同设备上可能不同。 Hexo错误安装时报错报错：Cannot find moudle 123&#123; [Error: Cannot find module &apos;./build/Release/DTraceProviderBindings&apos;] code: &apos;MODULE_NOT_FOUND&apos; &#125; &#123; [Error: Cannot find module &apos;./build/default/DTraceProviderBindings&apos;] code: &apos;MODULE_NOT_FOUND&apos; &#125; &#123; [Error: Cannot find module &apos;./build/Debug/DTraceProviderBindings&apos;] code: &apos;MODULE_NOT_FOUND&apos; &#125; 解决方案： 安装时Hexo时带上 --no-optional 命令 1$ npm install hexo --no-optional _config.yml编译不通过_config.yml编译不通过，报错略 解决方案： 仔细检查_config,yml文件，所有设置参数属性末尾都要加空格 deploy设置错误输入命令hexo deploy出现错误信息： 1&apos;github&apos; does not appear to be a git repository 解决方案： 检查_config.yml中deploy设置。参见http://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html。 删除.deploy_git文件夹并且执行hexo clean后，重新hexo deploy。 Git错误error deployer not found:github报错error deployer not found:github 解决方案： 修改_config.yml中type为git 12deploy: type: git 安装deploy依赖包 1npm install hexo-deployer-git –save 注意，Hexo3.0版本后才将deploye分离，此方法适用于Hexo3.0版本及以后。 github –crendetials: git is not command 报错：github --crendetials: git is not command 解决方案 检查与git shh是否连接 修改_config.yml中respository参数 12deploy: repository: ssh://git@github.com/yourname/yourname.github.io.git deploy参数设置注意，此配置针对Hexo3.0版本及以后。 1234deploy: type: git repository: ssh://git@github.com/yourname/yourname.github.io.git branch: yourbranch 许可本文章采用知识共享署名-非商业性使用-禁止演绎 3.0 许可协议进行许可，转载请注明来源。]]></content>
