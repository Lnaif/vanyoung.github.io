Thanks for your visiting. I'm **Naif**, an amateur Web developer majoring in Information Security since 2015. I named myself **乃逸夫** on the SNS in China, it's not my real name but a witty pseudonym.

# When, Where, What

1. Born in 1997, **Langzhong**, Sichuan.
2. Now in **Zhuhai**, Guangdong, a sophomore in Jinan University.
3. Mostly engaged in Penetration test, and stepped into Reverse engineering. Also as a less-skilled Front-end engineer.

# 乃逸夫

**逸** (yì) means free and natural , a belief in the way of life, and **夫** (fū) means a person, after the adjective. The  character **乃** (nǎi) in Classical Chinese could be explained *be* as a judgement word. So **乃逸夫** means:

> A man free and natural.

# Why Naif

**乃逸夫** pronounced as [nǎi yì fū] in Chinese, is very similar to the English word **naive**[naɪˈi:v].

**Naive** have a meaning of someone is artless, honest or kind, it's also an attitude of life.So I just simply replace the suffix **-ve** with **-f**, eventually **Naif** as a noun, could be interpreted as:

> An artless, honest and kind man.

**Naive** also means someone lacks experience and so expect things to be easy. So it's just a self-mockery, makes me always reflect on my past fault and raise my knowledge to avoid staying naive.

# Why EXCITING NOTES

I have decided to write some notes on the blog to record my learning experience and some inspiration early. When I retired from the JNA*(Jinan Network Alliance)* in July, the CEO, [Anqur](http://anqurvanillapy.github.io/index.html), left me a note:

> I bet you, write something exciting, the sooner get many stars on the Gayhub[:-P], the better.

That something could be code, payload and notes. So I simply named it **EXCITING NOTES**.

# Who is Dhakkan

A northern India slang, usually refers to a stupid person, comes from SQL injection learning platform,  [SQLI-LABS](https://github.com/Audi-1/sqli-labs). 

Innocent, I also named myself Dhakkan on the SNS sometimes, or, WELCOME.

# Slogan

> Mouth sealed, cash in.

This slogan comes from a Chinese proverb [闷声发大财](http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=TDp1L9MFB9ZjgNFDV6ASxtzDkYLJQ0bqdqWSzjvru1C7iypBhGxRzFFRYzMBOblzQ0Gzb9vi8lLSWdp3bWmN_v6UFhGJanw8W9g6cWtl49ahFPdjVbpD8rye4TUqPtGySZsdFUzehTA0tYRyE6LPFa), which has a long history and widely spreaded in recent years. According to the Baidu Encyclopedia, it explained as:

1. Sometimes do not talk to others or make publicity could better safeguard and protect your own interests.
2. Do not let others know what you are doing or see your benefits, to avoid letting others jealousy or envy.

In my opinion, is's original meaning is not teach people to become selfish. Instead, it could be interpreted as:

> The real wealthy people would not just say without practicing, but with practical action to prove themselves.

So yes, just make a move, no empty words.
